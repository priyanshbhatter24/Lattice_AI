FADE IN:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

Rain falls on cracked pavement. MAYA (30s), leather jacket slick with rain, walks alone past rusted shipping containers and graffiti-covered walls. The only light comes from a distant streetlamp.

                    MAYA (V.O.)
          Sometimes you have to get lost to
          find what you're looking for.

She stops at a metal door, checks her phone, then knocks three times.

INT. UPSCALE COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Warm lighting filters through floor-to-ceiling windows. Exposed brick walls. Reclaimed wood tables. The soft hiss of an espresso machine.

JAMES (40s), salt-and-pepper hair, sits at a corner table. Laptop open, espresso untouched. He watches the door.

Maya enters, shaking rain from her hair. She spots James and crosses to him.

                    JAMES
          You're late.

                    MAYA
          Traffic.

She sits. A BARISTA approaches.

                    BARISTA
          What can I get you?

                    MAYA
          Just black coffee. Thanks.

The barista leaves. James closes his laptop.

                    JAMES
          Did you bring it?

Maya slides a manila envelope across the table.

EXT. BEACH HOUSE DECK - SUNSET

Waves crash against rocks below. The sky is painted in oranges and pinks.

Maya and James stand at a weathered wooden railing. A bottle of wine sits between them, two glasses half-full.

                    JAMES
          So what happens now?

                    MAYA
          Now we wait.

She takes a sip of wine, eyes on the horizon.

                    MAYA (CONT'D)
          The sun sets. The tide comes in.
          Everything changes.

James turns to look at her.

                    JAMES
          And us?

She doesn't answer. The sun touches the water.

INT. VINTAGE APARTMENT - MORNING

Sunlight streams through tall windows with original crown moldings. Dust motes float in the golden beams.

Maya wakes in a brass bed with white linens. She's disoriented. The room is decorated in 1950s style - a rotary phone, vintage posters, a tube radio on the nightstand.

                    MAYA
          Where am I?

She sits up, looks around. On the bedside table: a note.

INSERT - THE NOTE

"Check under the radio. -J"

BACK TO SCENE

Maya reaches for the radio, lifts it. Underneath: a key.

EXT. ROOFTOP BAR - NIGHT

The city sparkles below. String lights crisscross overhead. A jazz trio plays in the corner.

Maya sits alone at the bar, nursing a martini. The KEY dangles from a chain around her neck.

                    BARTENDER
          Waiting for someone?

                    MAYA
          Always.

She finishes her drink, leaves cash on the bar, and walks toward the exit.

                    MAYA (V.O.)
          Some doors are meant to stay locked.
          Others...

She touches the key at her throat.

                    MAYA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Others are meant to be opened.

FADE OUT.
